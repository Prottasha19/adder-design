# adder-design

The design flow for creating an IC. Here I developed an 8-bit adder with registered inputs and outputs.

The design flow includes the following steps:

	a. RTL design and simulation
	b. Synthesis of the RTL code to produce a netlist
	c. Simulation of the gate-level netlist with back-annotated delays
	d. Place and Route of the design to produce a layout
